# Goal
My goal is to train a model that can predict heart disease accurately</br>
# Overview
Cardiovascular disease(CVD), also known as heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. In the United states, one person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease.From 2014 to 2015, the Heart disease costs in United States was about $219 billion. Therefore, it is very important to understand the correlations with the risk factors. In this project I will explore the dataset to understand the correlation and use a machine learning model to predict heart disease. Also, I will compare among different models and present the accuracy of each model.
# Data</br>
